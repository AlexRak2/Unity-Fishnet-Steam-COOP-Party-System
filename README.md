# Coop Party Template for Unity with Fishnet and Facepunch Steam

This is an advanced cooperative party system template designed for Unity, utilizing [Fishnet](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet) for networking and [Facepunch](https://wiki.facepunch.com/steamworks/) Steamworks for Steam integration.

I've developed this template for a project I'm currently working on and decided to share it with the community for free. This template provides a CO-OP main menu system. You can create a party, join an existing party or find a match.

One of the features of this template is its integration with Steam. You'll find a friends list menu where you can invite your Steam friends to join your party. All lobby connections are handled using Steam lobbies. All players must ready up in order to start the game. The game consist of a basic fps controller and demo scene. Enough for you guys to make a game out of.
